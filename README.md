# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Introduction
Stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile, making it challenging to model stock prices accurately over time. This project aims to predict the stock prices using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The model utilizes historical equity share price data to predict future prices based on features such as Opening price, day High, day Low, Close price, and Volume.

## Project Overview
The proposed system involves several stages, from data collection to output generation. The project is divided into the following stages:
1. Raw Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction
4. Training the Neural Network
5. Output Generation


## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Python script:
    ```sh
    python Stock Price Prediction.py
    ```

4. Refer to the `Stock Price Prediction Report.pdf` for detailed insights and analysis.

## Conclusion
The successful prediction of stock prices using the LSTM model can be a valuable asset for stock market institutions and provide real-life solutions to stock investors.
